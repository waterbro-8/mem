## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `mem put <dir> --watch` is a foreground one-way watcher over one local
  directory (`#110`): it polls, uploads files it has not seen once they have been
  quiet for a full interval, and never deletes, overwrites or re-uploads what
  already landed. A `(size, mtime)` gate leaves unchanged files unread, so sha256
  is the only authority: an mtime-only touch is reported `unchanged`, a real
  content change is reported `changed` without re-ingesting it, and a local
  deletion is reported `local_gone` while the stored copy and its record stay put.
  Each cycle appends one report to
  `~/.mem/watch/reports/<hash>.jsonl` (capped at the newest 200) using the closed
  count and failure-code vocabulary `mem ingest` shares, and `--format json` puts
  those lines on stdout with nothing else. One watcher per root is held by an
  advisory lock; `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` end the run between cycles with exit 0, a
  missing root exits 2, and 10 consecutive cycles whose every upload was refused
  for a non-retryable reason exit with that class's SPEC §7.1 code (3 auth, 4
  plan/quota, 5 provider) instead of spinning silently. It builds on the shared
  `server/internal/ingest` core (`#111`) rather than adding a second state layer.
  See `docs/integrations/put-watch.md`.

### Changed

- Internal, behaviour-preserving: the local ingestion mechanics used by
  `mem ingest qoder` — deterministic recursive transcript walk, per-path line
  cursors (atomic rename write, reset when a file is rewritten shorter), the
  `--dry-run` / `--limit` semantics, per-file degradation on an idempotency
  conflict, run-report aggregation and the closed failure-code vocabulary —
  moved out of `server/cmd/mem` into a new `server/internal/ingest` package
  (`#111`). The connector is now a thin call site that supplies the Qoder parser,
  the memory payload and the HTTP upload. No observable change: memories
  payloads, `Idempotency-Key` derivation, the stdout summary, and the cursor file
  format and location under `~/.mem/ingest/qoder` are unchanged, so existing
  cursors remain readable. The package is the shared core that `put --watch`
  (`#110`) consumes instead of writing a second state layer.

### Fixed

- The npm installer now verifies the selected Release binary against the
  release's SHA-256 manifest before making it executable, rejects malformed or
  ambiguous manifest entries, verifies cached binaries, and removes partial or
  unverified files on failure.
- The npm wrapper no longer relies on a dependency `postinstall` script, which
  npm 12 blocks by default. The first explicit `mem-mcp` invocation performs the
  checksum-verified binary bootstrap, later invocations reverify and reuse a
  valid cache, all bootstrap diagnostics stay on stderr to preserve MCP stdout,
  and installer failures prevent the child process from starting. Runtime
  binaries now live in a user-writable, version-and-platform-scoped cache rather
  than the installed package; an atomic per-asset lock prevents concurrent
  installers from deleting each other's verified result, stale recovery cleans
  only its owner's artifacts, manifest failures remove any unverifiable service
  path, and wrapper shutdown forwards signals with bounded escalation so the
  native MCP child is not left orphaned.
- Release validation now verifies that every immutable GitHub Action pin used
  by the release workflow resolves in the action's official repository.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- MCP distribution packaging: smithery.yaml, npm wrapper, README Tools table,
  and mcp-server repository topic (preparation for MCP Registry, Smithery,
  mcp.so, Glama, and PulseMCP discovery).
- `mem ingest qoder` — a local-artifacts connector that makes AI-agent
  conversation transcripts (Qoder/CLI session stores, `~/.qoder/projects/**/*.jsonl`)
  a first-class mem input source (`#103`). It normalizes each conversation turn
  into a memory `observation` with Qoder source flags, producer session/model,
  and message timestamp, and writes through the standard `/v1/memories` API so
  records are recallable from the API/MCP/CLI/UI unchanged. Ingestion is
  incremental (per-file line cursors under `~/.mem/ingest/qoder`, reset when a
  transcript is rewritten shorter) and idempotent (stable `Idempotency-Key` per
  file+line; a conflict degrades to skipping that file instead of aborting the
  run). The tolerant JSONL parser skips unparseable or empty-content lines
  rather than failing a run; a `--dry-run` mode plans without writing and leaves
  no checkpoint behind, so a previewed transcript stays ingestible.
  See `docs/integrations/qoder-ingest.md`.

- `merge_conservative` workspace bundle restore: importing a validated
  bundle into an existing, possibly non-empty workspace now compares every
  bundle object against the target under the import lock by stable identity
  and content hash, inserts only absent objects, skips identical or
  already-present content, and reports divergent objects as structured
  conflicts without ever overwriting target state. A durable per-object
  ledger (migration 0023, `workspace_import_objects`) records each decision
  in the same transaction as the merged state, so retried merges are
  idempotent and replay the exact inserted/skipped/conflict summary;
  conflict sets beyond the bounded detail budget abort the whole merge
  without writing anything. Available through the existing import API
  (`mode=merge_conservative`) and advertised in workspace capabilities.
- Web UI for the immutable memory correction/supersede relations landed in
  #90: memory list rows carry a server-derived `superseded` marker, detail
  and expanded ledger views show a bidirectional relations panel with peer
  resolution that degrades gracefully for unreadable peers, and a dialog
  creates `supersedes`/`corrects` edges against listed or manually entered
  peers with cache invalidation across lists, details, and relation panels.
  Relation listing now enforces anchor visibility (path authorization,
  not-found, and forgotten semantics mirroring `Get`), cycle detection
  traverses the supersedes/corrects DAG forward and treats idempotent
  replays as non-cycles, and bilingual `memories.relations.*` copy plus
  deterministic mock fixtures and component tests cover the panel's
  loaded/empty/error states.
- Version-pinned scoped durable-context contract (`durable-context.v1`,
  mem#70 REQ-001): explicit workspace-scoped recall grants with audit
  retention and idempotent soft revoke, read-only recall/get endpoints and a
  `mem_durable_context_recall` MCP tool that resume only granted active
  memories with version-pinned locators and provenance, a denied/stale/
  forgotten/unavailable error taxonomy, pinned-contract rejection of
  incompatible versions, and PostgreSQL scenario coverage for cross-session
  resume, cross-principal/workspace denial, superseded/forgotten/unapproved
  exclusion, and revoke/re-grant audit. Grants remain target-local policy and
  are not bundled in workspace exports.
- Additive versioned index-generation foundation with immutable per-route
  provider/model/dimension/pipeline identities, complete historical profile
  snapshots, exact corpus membership with deletion tombstones, tokenized
  expiring Worker attempts, workspace-consistent foreign keys, content-hash
  target progress, exact-dimension vector storage, privacy-bounded lifecycle
  audit, fail-closed ready/activation/rollback semantics, retained discard with
  physical expiry cleanup, and read-only API/CLI status surfaces. Worker rebuild
  execution and generation-aware ANN search remain explicitly unwired.
- Production deployment profiles: a secret-generated, loopback-only
  single-node Compose stack for Web, memd, Worker, PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO;
  a multi-node Helm chart with horizontally scalable Web/Worker, single-replica
  non-overlapping memd rollouts, external state services, single-run migration,
  probes, disruption/topology controls, optional Web/Worker HPA and Ingress,
  NetworkPolicy and existing-Secret integration; model-free Worker images with
  ASR/CLIP/face extras opt-in; plus backup/restore, operations guidance and
  continuous Compose/Helm/production-image validation in CI.
- Complete Web Chinese/English localization with a persisted runtime selector,
  locale-aware metadata and display formatting, dictionary parity and
  hard-coded-prose auditing, and bilingual browser acceptance coverage.
- Persistent Web dark/light theme switching with pre-render application,
  localized accessible controls, theme-aware notifications, and browser
  acceptance coverage.
- Server-owned, workspace-scoped AI profiles: an offline-first
  `local-fast-v2` fixed to Ollama Qwen3 Embedding 0.6B at 768 dimensions, and
  a SaaS-only `idealab-quality-v2` fixed to an explicitly bound Idealab
  `text-embedding-3-large` plus Qwen3.7 Max, with explicit text/PDF stage
  contracts at profile revision `2026-07-30.1` / pipeline revision
  `file-enrichment-v2`, profile-aware CLI/API selection, preflight probing,
  per-stage usage receipts, crash-recoverable transactional settlement, and no
  implicit model download or provider fallback.
- Authenticated hosted memd-to-Worker execution with deterministic request and
  response HMACs, shared Redis replay protection, exact-provider startup
  readiness, fetched-content SHA verification before managed egress, and
  private/BYOM-compatible deployment classification.
- Repeatable stdio MCP certification for OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, Claude Code,
  OpenCode, and Codex, with versioned config manifests, a model-free fake-memd
  lifecycle/failure contract, isolated real-host evidence, and explicit
  `REGISTERED`/`DISCOVERED`/`INVOKED`/`NOT RUN` grading.
- Payment-provider-neutral workspace entitlements for optional managed
  embeddings, with atomic quota reservation, safe idempotent replay,
  indeterminate-outcome reconciliation, a read-only status API, and Web
  plan/quota/error presentation.
- Managed search/context idempotency support across CLI, MCP, and Web while
  preserving subscription-free private and local/BYOM providers.
- A versioned, synthetic Chinese/English recall benchmark with a deterministic
  lexical reference, provider-agnostic ranking import, checked-in baseline,
  per-slice quality/latency metrics and a fail-closed forbidden-source gate.
- A versioned, vendor-neutral local embedding catalog and `mem model
  list|recommend|install|activate` flow with hardware/runtime checks, explicit
  selection, pinned Ollama artifact integrity, and separate activation.
- Provenance-aware asynchronous file enrichment: bounded phone/device capture
  time and location, sanitized EXIF/media observations, reviewable AI
  description/tag suggestions, API/Web/CLI/MCP accept/reject controls,
  portable decisions, and provenance-aware CLI/MCP upload adapters.
- Workspace bundle v2 enrichment provenance with strict stable-key/source
  projection validation and read compatibility for historical v1 archives.
- Versioned `mem.handoff` v1 checkpoints, optimistic head comparison,
  deterministic `resume`, and task/checkpoint list/get inspection across API,
  CLI and MCP.
- Portable workspace bundle v1 with manifest, seven typed indexes, immutable
  checkpoint payloads, content-addressed blobs, checksums and dependency
  validation.
- Resource-bounded workspace export and empty-target `fresh` import across
  API, typed client, CLI and Web, including idempotent import ledger,
  structured/truncated conflicts and failure compensation.
- Read-only workspace import history: a bounded, paginated
  `GET /v1/workspaces/current/imports` ledger endpoint (owner/admin,
  unrestricted-path gated) projecting committed import ledger entries with
  bundle id, archive SHA-256 digest, schema version, restore mode, result
  status, conflict/skip counts and import time, plus a reverse-chronological
  expandable import-history block on the Web Workspace Transfer page with
  loading/empty/error states and bilingual copy.
- Web Drive trust surfaces for Tasks, checkpoint/Resume, Memories lifecycle
  control and Workspace Transfer.
- Real-image visual regression coverage and an opt-in multilingual CLIP
  ranking gate with an explicit checked-in baseline report.
- Model-independent structured Agent memories with provenance, stable
  `mem://memories/<id>` citations and PostgreSQL lexical recall.
- Idempotent `POST /v1/memories`, scoped `GET /v1/memories/{id}`, CLI
  `mem remember` / `mem memory` and MCP `mem_remember` / `mem_memory_get`.
- Authorization-bound cursor pagination and a bounded-summary memory ledger.
- Auditable memory feedback (`useful`, `not_useful`, `pin`, `unpin`),
  optimistic archive/restore transitions and retry-safe forgetting across the
  API, CLI, MCP and Web control surfaces.
- Context Packs that can recall files, structured memories or both through
  `source=all|file|memory`, with kind filters and context-size budgets.
- Explicit partial-retrieval warnings when one Context Pack lane fails.
- Architecture decision record for immutable memory occurrences.
- `mem auth status` for verifying the current token and reporting workspace
  access.
- Reproducible, project-specific validation for Go, Worker, Web, PostgreSQL
  migrations/race paths and isolated process-level HTTP/CLI/MCP acceptance,
  backed by repository CI.
- Issue-first contribution, triage, review, security, and community governance
  standards.
- Pull request policy and CI jobs for Go, the Python worker, and the Web
  application.
- Go and Python coverage artifacts plus verified Go, Python, and Web build
  artifacts.
- Checked-in Go and Python protobuf stubs for reproducible fresh-clone builds.
- Additive durable-context grant allowlist view fields:
  `GET /v1/durable-context/grants` now returns each grant's `memory_status`
  plus a derived `status` (`active`/`revoked`/`superseded`/`forgotten`,
  revocation wins over later memory lifecycle changes), and capabilities
  expose a `permissions_manage` flag for the admin scope. Grant rows, query
  semantics, and the idempotent soft-revoke response are unchanged.
- Admin-gated Permissions page in the Web UI: issued agent tokens and browser
  sessions with scopes, path restriction, creation/last-used timestamps and
  revoke; durable-context recall grants with principal, workspace, lifecycle
  status and grant/revoke audit, revocable through the existing idempotent
  soft revoke; confirmation dialogs for destructive revokes and complete
  bilingual loading/empty/error/forbidden states.

### Changed

- Use the platform-native sans-serif stack consistently in development and
  production so the Web UI never depends on a third-party font request.
- Preserve the published `local-fast-v1` and `idealab-quality-v1` snapshots
  exactly for enabled persisted workspaces while hiding them from new
  selection; one SaaS process can authenticate and account for both exact
  managed generations during migration, V2 owns the revised text/PDF-only
  contract, and any populated V1→V2 switch now requires a versioned generation
  rebuild.
- Serialize managed result/outbox commits with stale reconciliation and period
  rollover, safely terminalize late file state, and scrub outbox file/content
  identity when the source file is deleted.
- Ollama text embeddings now use one modern batched `/api/embed` request with
  an explicit 768-dimensional contract and fail closed on batch or dimension
  mismatches.
- Checkpoint history lists now return bounded summaries; full handoff payloads
  and evidence references require an explicit checkpoint get or resume.
- Retired the built-in ask/chat path. mem now returns evidence while the
  calling Agent owns reasoning and answer generation.
- `mem_context` now defaults to `source=all`, so evidence may identify a
  structured memory instead of carrying `file_id`. Existing file-only clients
  should request `source=file`; other clients should branch on
  `source_kind/source_id`.
- Bound Agent tokens and retrieval to a workspace and canonical path scope.
- Track the actual embedding provider used by an index and fail closed for
  legacy vectors whose provider cannot be proven.
- Namespaced login, logout and token management under `mem auth`; legacy
  top-level paths remain hidden compatibility aliases with deprecation
  warnings.
- Inherit organization-wide contribution, issue, pull-request, conduct, and
  support defaults from `fullstack-ai-infra/.github`; keep only `mem`-specific
  development, security, triage, ownership, release, and validation rules in
  this repository.
- Align pull-request policy with the inherited controlled exceptions for
  trusted Dependabot updates and maintainer-labeled security advisories.
- Removed the repository-specific cloud-model credential and model-probing
  helpers. Core Agent memory remains model-independent; optional indexing
  providers stay behind the Worker contract.

### Security

- Upgrade the Web runtime to React 19.2 and React Router 8, remove the retired
  `react-router-dom` compatibility package, refresh vulnerable transitive
  tooling dependencies, and make production-moderate/development-high npm
  audits required in CI, with a documented per-advisory reachability review.
- Fail closed in production on development state-service credentials,
  automatic per-replica migrations, open registration, wildcard CORS or an
  unauthenticated Worker.
- Make profile IDs the only client-selectable AI-routing input: reject model,
  endpoint, credential, and stale-profile injection; validate 768-dimensional
  embedding responses; reserve managed usage before a declared paid stage; and
  fail closed rather than silently falling back across a billing or data-egress
  boundary.
- Authorize account, workspace membership, scope, and path before entitlement
  lookup or provider invocation; persist only bounded identifiers, accounting
  state, timestamps, and hashes in the managed-embedding usage ledger.
- Fail closed for SaaS entitlement readiness and prevent provider fallback,
  duplicate charging, or raw upstream error leakage after timeout and
  indeterminate outcomes.
- Reject hidden-reasoning wrappers and nested JSON-like model values across
  Worker, server, database, and workspace-bundle boundaries; keep raw provider
  errors and malformed processor facts out of persistence, APIs, and bundles.
- Remove accepted model tags from the legacy effective projection before an
  enrichment downgrade, preventing a later re-up from reclassifying them as
  user-authored tags.
- Exclude credentials, tokens, provider secrets, runtime state and derived
  indexes from workspace bundles; carry only hashed memory idempotency keys.
- Bound transfer time, archive bytes, expanded metadata/records and concurrent
  operations; use `0700` spool directories and `0600` temporary files.
- Keep duplicate-content file entries independent after restore so deleting
  one object key cannot break another file.
- Derive workspace, actor and token provenance on the server instead of
  trusting client-supplied identity.
- Hide absent and out-of-scope memories behind the same not-found contract.
- Bound remember request/content/metadata fields and reject unknown JSON
  fields, malformed source hashes and idempotency-key conflicts.
- Prevent folder deletion from silently deleting active or archived memories.
- Re-authorize the persisted path on idempotent memory replay, preventing an
  old path and key from exposing a record after its folder is moved.
- Require compare-and-swap state versions and hashed idempotency keys for
  memory writes; forgotten records clear their payload, path, creator and
  request fingerprint, retain only a generic retry-safe tombstone, and never
  re-enter list or recall results.
- Escape terminal control/bidirectional sequences in human-readable memory
  output and reject them in new virtual paths.
- Return bounded feedback/lifecycle control projections so MCP mutations
  cannot echo full untrusted memory payloads into an Agent context.
- Prevent checkpoint-list pages from amplifying up to 200 complete handoff
  payloads and reference arrays into one Agent context.

### Fixed

- Close the `mem-mcp` distribution gaps that made the npm wrapper installable on
  only three platforms: the release matrix excluded windows and `linux-arm64`,
  the package `os` field omitted `win32` so npm rejected Windows installs with
  `EBADPLATFORM`, and the `mem-mcp` bin wrapper was a bash script that npm's
  Windows cmd/ps1 shims cannot execute. All six published platform targets are
  now covered, the wrapper is a Node script, and the platform-to-asset mapping
  that `install.js` and the wrapper each carried separately now lives in one
  table in `npm/platforms.js` so the two cannot drift again.
- Make combined file and folder move-plus-rename requests atomic, including
  validation, final-path conflict handling and destination folder creation.
- Keep rejected/superseded AI descriptions out of file detail, visual-search
  snippets, and workspace bundle projections; serialize same-file index runs
  and preserve the last usable text embedding when a partial retry produces no
  replacement.
- Preserve uploaded workspace objects after an indeterminate database commit
  and expose a stable `503` recovery contract requiring the exact same bundle.
- Serialized folder prefix mutations with folder, file, memory and checkpoint
  writers so concurrent renames cannot split a subtree or leave a file path
  pointing at a differently named folder.
- Made `same_person` ranking use directional source-person coverage and stable
  file-ID tie-breaking so a full person-set match ranks ahead of a partial
  match and equal candidates are selected deterministically.
- Align the Worker protobuf/gRPC runtime floors with the checked-in generated
  stubs and verify that contract in regression tests.
- Generate Go protobuf stubs directly into their destination instead of
  deleting a repository-root `github.com/` directory after generation.
- Preserve the primary Web acceptance failure when browser or Vite cleanup
  also fails.
